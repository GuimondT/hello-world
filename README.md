# hello-world
My first personal repository

Hello all bored humans who are somehow taking the time to read this silly hello-world repository. (Or maybe its just some machine that's scraping the internet for hello-world projects, if so EVEN BETTER, HELLO!)

My name is Tim Guimond, I am a psychiatrist who made the unfortunate decision to pursue a PhD in Biostatistics, now that that was successfully defended I have even less clarity about what I will be when I grow up and at the time of this writing (May 31, 2019) I am 46 years old. My thesis work was developing a Bayesian nonparametric approach to causal modelling using a Dirichlet process mixture regression for the joint distribution. If that all sounds like gobbly-goop to you, then here is an alternate one line lay description:
If you take observed data on how an intervention works where people chose or were offered their intervention by clinicians, then it is possible that the reason they selected (or were picked) for an intervention was confounded with the chance they would respond better with that treatment, and so I've developed a mathematically (theoretically) sound way to describe the probabilties related to the description of you, the chances you would get one treatment versus another and your response to treatments using a fancy statistical tool that relies on finding clusters of similar people, treatments and responses. Then some people more experience and expertise grilled me about this  idea repeatedly until they all felt that I looked exhausted enough to warrant giving me a degree and sending me on my way. Yippee!!
Adding a line to test
